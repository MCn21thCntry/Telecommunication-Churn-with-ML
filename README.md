# Telco Churn Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn for a fictional telecom company based in California. Using data from the third quarter, the model will identify which customers are likely to leave, stay, or sign up for services.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to predict which customers are going to churn from the telecom services using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Story

The dataset contains information about 7,043 customers who use home phone and Internet services provided by the fictional telecom company in California. It includes details on whether customers discontinued their services, continued, or signed up during the third quarter.
